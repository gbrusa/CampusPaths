# CampusPaths
CampusPaths was a class project that involved creating an Android app allowing the user to find shortest paths between locations on the UW-Seattle campus. To complete the project, I had to first design a graph implementation before adding methods which ran BFS and Dijkstra's algorithms on the graph. \
The implementation was tested by searching for connections between characters in the Marvel Comics universe, before being used in the Android App.
